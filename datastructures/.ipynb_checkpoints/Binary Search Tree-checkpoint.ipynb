Accorsing to our program, the first thing that our program must do is return 'printhello()', becaused it was called first. So we go throught the function step by step.</font>"

It looks like a tree, made up of smaller SUB-TREES, and those sub-trees are also made up of sub-trees. And that my friends, is why recursion is so important when we have to understand trees. Eventually, recursively, we get to a point where the 'sub trees' are just nodes. which is why the node is so important in the tree as well."
